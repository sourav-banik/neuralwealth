# neuralwealth
NeuralWealth is an advanced financial advisor bot that combines large language model (LLM) capabilities with data science and financial analysis to provide dynamic investment recommendations. The system acts as a "robot scientist" that continuously gathers market data, formulates investment hypotheses, tests them, and refines its knowledge to optimize portfolio suggestions.
System Architecture
Core Components

    1. LLM Brain (LLaMA-3-70B)

        * Base knowledge repository and reasoning engine

        * Hypothesis generation and natural language processing

        * Explanation and recommendation formulation

    2. Data Acquisition Layer

        * Financial data: yfinance (stock prices, fundamentals)

        * Macroeconomic data: Macrotrends, FRED

        * News/sentiment: Twitter API, Google RSS feeds

        * Alternative data sources (as available)

    3. Hypothesis Engine

        * Formulates testable investment theses based on:

            => LLM's financial knowledge

            => Current market conditions

            => Identified data patterns

    4. Backtesting System

        * Historical simulation of investment strategies

        * Risk/reward analysis

        * Hypothesis validation/rejection

    5. Knowledge Refinement Loop

        * Updates LLM's financial understanding based on backtest results

        * Stores validated strategies in a retrievable format

    6. Portfolio Optimization

        * Modern portfolio theory implementation

        * Risk-adjusted return optimization

        * Dynamic asset allocation

    7. User Interface

        * Web-based dashboard

        * Natural language interaction

        * Visualization of recommendations and performance

Workflow

    1. Data Collection Phase

        * Continuous scraping/API calls to gather fresh market data

        * Data cleaning and normalization

        * Storage in structured database

    2. Analysis & Hypothesis Generation

        * LLM reviews current portfolio and market conditions

        * Identifies potential opportunities based on patterns

        * Formulates specific, testable investment hypotheses (e.g., "Tech stocks will outperform in Q3 due to anticipated Fed rate cuts")

    3. Backtesting & Validation

        * Historical simulation of hypothesis

        * Statistical significance testing

        * Risk assessment

    4. Knowledge Update

        * Successful hypotheses added to knowledge base

        * Failed hypotheses analyzed for pattern avoidance

    5. Portfolio Recommendation

        * Optimal allocation based on validated strategies

        * Risk-adjusted position sizing

        * Clear entry/exit criteria

    6. User Presentation

        * Natural language explanation of recommendations

        * Visualizations of expected performance

        * Risk metrics and alternative scenarios
