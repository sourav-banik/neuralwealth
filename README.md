# neuralwealth
NeuralWealth is an advanced financial advisor bot that combines large language model (LLM) capabilities with data science and financial analysis to provide dynamic investment recommendations. The system acts as a "robot scientist" that continuously gathers market data, formulates investment hypotheses, tests them, and refines its knowledge to optimize portfolio suggestions.

NeuralWealth System Architecture
1. Data Layer

    Components:

        Market Data API (yFinance)

        News/Sentiment Scraper (Twitter, Google News, Reddit)

        Macro Trends (FRED)

    Functionality:

        Ingests real-time market data, news, and macroeconomic indicators.

        Preprocesses data (normalization, feature engineering).

        Outputs structured data for analysis.

2. Robot Scientist (AI Research Lab)

    Components:

        Hypothesis Generator (LLM)

            Uses LLaMA-3 to propose investment theses (e.g., "AI stocks will outperform in Q3").

        Backtesting Engine (RL)

            Tests hypotheses via reinforcement learning (PPO/SAC).

            Simulates trades on historical data.

        Auto-Experiment Designer

            Iterates on failed hypotheses (e.g., adjusts timeframes, asset filters).

        Knowledge Graph

            Stores validated strategies (e.g., "NVDA rallies post-earnings").

    Workflow:

        LLM generates hypotheses → RL backtests them.

        Successful strategies → Added to Knowledge Graph.

        Failed strategies → Auto-Experiment Designer tweaks parameters → Retest.

3. Portfolio Management (RL Agent)

    Components:

        RL Portfolio Agent

            State: Portfolio holdings + market conditions.

            Action: Buy/sell/rebalance.

            Reward: Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio).

        Rebalancing Engine

            Executes trades via broker API (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers).

            Enforces constraints (e.g., max sector exposure).

    Workflow:

        Queries Knowledge Graph for validated strategies.

        RL Agent selects optimal actions → Rebalancing Engine executes.

        Updates User Portfolio.

4. User Interface

    Components:

        Chat Interface (Gradio/Streamlit)

            Users ask questions (e.g., "Why did you sell TSLA?").

            LLM responds with explanations ("TSLA hit target price + earnings risk increased").

        User Feedback

            Thumbs up/down → Fine-tunes RL reward function.
